== Cine Passion API Key
In my project, you can find my Cine Passion API Key.

Please don't use mine.

In fact if you need a key for your own project, you can request one here :

== XML Sample files
To start devel on my project I made sample files. You can found them on test/data folder. At this time I have theres :
cinepassion-scraper-test-00-no-response.xml -> No response from scraper
cinepassion-scraper-test-01-one-response.xml -> One result from scraper
cinepassion-scraper-test-02-mutiple-response.xml -> Many result from scraper

In "exploded" directory, I have "translate" files in human readable format (only with indentation ;) ). Do not use there files.

== Check if my lib work in your side
- Install ruby
- ruby -Ilib test/test_cine_passion.rb

== Sample files comming soon
